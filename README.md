# SCENARIO

What do I watch tonight ?! Good question, right ?!
Here's the React Native version of [Scenario](https://scenario.vivianquerenet.com/), my website based on TMDB API to help you find something to watch for tonight.

## Installation

Fork the project.
You also need to fork the API, available [here](https://github.com/LightQv/scenario-api).

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install every dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

PS: You'll need to have Android Studio or Xcode properly configurate in order to emulate the application.

## Usage

Use Expo to launch the simulation.

```javascript
npx expo start

# Now, enjoy!
```

## Demo

I'm not a part of Apple Developer Program, therefore I'm not able to share the app on the Apple Store. 
So, here's a Youtube video showing the main functionnalities.
